## About uproot

uproot is a modern, open-source framework for developing and conducting browser-based behavioral experiments. This includes studies with hundreds of participants such as large-scale surveys and is not limited to experiments with individual, isolated decision but also covers experiments with real-time interaction between the participants.

## Most important features

Here is a quick overview of the central features of uproot:

* uproot is built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"}.
* uproot revolutionizes data storage with an append-only log. This ensures data persistence and permits the use of arbitrary data types.
* It provides many convenient features for various types of studies. For example, Likert scales are provided out of the box, file uploads are possible, and error messages and translations can be customized easily.
* With capabilities such as page repetition, random page orderings, indefinitely repeated sets of pages, management of individual subjects, dynamically sized sessions, and convenient APIs, uproot overcomes many limitations of other experimental frameworks.

## Getting in touch
